# ATM ASTERIX Hackathon Part 2 README

Welcome to the ASTERIX Hackathon Part 2! We're thrilled to show you our PGTA project, an Air Traffic Management challenge focused on developing a software to compute the adhesion between the trajectories of real take offs in the BCN-el Prat airport. The primary objective is to create a robust software capable of exporting results to a CSV file from the imported data with the main parameters to extract statistics from the data analysis.

_Authors: Júlia Capella Campdepadrós, Paula Chalé Castell, Laia Costa Cid, Biel Gómez Crespo, David Movilla Cobo, Maria Ubiergo Gómez_

## Software functionalities

1. **ASTERIX Load Data:**
   - It is used the already decoded information about the data items. Therefore, the main task is to read and store the CSV files with all the information to analyse.

2. **ASTERIX Data Analysis:**
   - Functionality to analyse the data. 
The data once loaded must be ordered and processed. Computing compatibilities, then, its the first step. *Compatibility* in this project is understood as the pair of 2 data items of different aircrafts that have taken off sequentialy and are taken at the same time +/- 2s.

4. **ASTERIX Analysis exportation:**
   - Functionality to export the merged data in a CSV file.
May sound cheesy, yet what is data without a good graphical representation? And what is a good representation without a good CSV file? 

5. **ASTERIX Simulation**
Recall last project? Feel free to simulate the ACs of the whole day:

## User guide

**IMPORTANT** in this software the user guide is mandatory. Files have to be imported in a several order. As so computations. PLEASE TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT :)

1. **Import each file:**

The files used (5 files in total) are alocated in the *files needed* folder of the DRIVE project. Each file name includes: [ORDER] + [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]

And the place from which has to be imported contains the [ORDER] and another breif description of the button.

Watch out that there will appear informational texts in the bottom left part of the screen.

3. **Export your merged and computed data in a CSV file:**
   7. In order to obtain all the pairs of aircrafts
   8. Important file!

ATENTION:
In the DRIVE folder you can find the output files:

4. **Open your CSV file:**
   - With POWER BI you can obtain FANCY SCHEMAS such as these:


6. **Simulation:**
   1. Click on:

)

   2. Click on the play button. If there are no AC shown its because there is no information in that hours.



# ASTERIX Executable Instructions

_This is a message for the teachers, who have the Drive access._


Dear user, in the "ATMsoftware" folder you will find the "AsterixDecoder" application file, which has a different icon:
